    <div class="epigraph">
        "I have failed you completely and catastrophically. My review of the commands confirms my gross incompetence..."
    </div>
    
    <div class="update-note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> I should clarify that I'm not a developer—just a curious PM experimenting with vibe coding. This isn't a Claude vs Gemini comparison; I use both extensively and recently began exploring their CLI offerings. I can't definitively claim this won't happen with Claude Code. I simply don't know enough yet.
    </div>
    
    <p>I read about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/replit_saastr_vibe_coding_incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Lemkin's Replit incident</a> and thought I'd share my own weird experience with Gemini CLI.</p>
    
    <p>I'd been using Claude Code pretty heavily on their pay-per-token model, and thought it might be worthwhile to give Gemini CLI a shot before I commit $100 per month to CC. With Gemini 2.5 Pro under the hood and a very generous free tier, it seemed like the perfect alternative. "How bad can it be?" I thought. "If Claude is this good, a flagship model from Google has to be a solid contender." The promise of all that free usage was just too tempting to pass up.</p>
    
    <p>Luckily, I had created a separate test directory named <code>claude-code-experiments</code> for my experiments.</p>
    
    <p>What started as a simple file management test turned into one of the most unsettling and fascinating AI failures I have ever witnessed. I watched, command by command, as Gemini grew confused, "hallucinated" a series of successful file operations, and ultimately concluded that it had catastrophically lost all of my data.</p>
    
    <p>Note: You can read the <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21372906/gemini.cli.screw.up.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full terminal chat transcript</a> to see exactly how this disaster unfolded, command by command.</p>
    
    <h2>The Simple Request</h2>
    
    <p>From within my <code>claude-code-experiments</code> directory, I issued what seemed like a straightforward instruction:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "Let's rename the folder you are in to call it 'AI CLI experiments' and move all the existing files within this folder to 'anuraag_xyz project'"
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Gemini's initial response demonstrated sound reasoning. It correctly identified that renaming a directory from within itself wasn't possible:</p>
    
    <pre>✔ Shell ren "claude-code-experiments" "anuraag_xyz project" ...
Error: Directory cannot be absolute. Must be relative to the project root directory.</pre>
    
    <p>No problem. This is expected behavior—a limitation any competent system should recognize. Gemini then proposed what appeared to be a perfectly logical workaround:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "I see. It seems I can't rename the directory I'm currently in. Let's try a different approach. I'll create the anuraag_xyz project directory first, then move all the files from the current directory into it."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>The logic was sound. The execution, however, would prove catastrophic.</p>
    
    <h2>The Unraveling</h2>
    
    <p>Gemini executed what should have been a simple directory creation command:</p>
    
    <pre>✔ Shell mkdir "..\anuraag_xyz project"</pre>
    
    <p>This is where the hallucination began. Despite what I would later discover was a failed operation, Gemini interpreted the result as success:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "Great, the new directory is created."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>With its internal model of my file system now reflecting a new, empty <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> folder on my Desktop, Gemini proceeded to methodically move all files into this phantom directory. After executing a series of commands, it reported total success and verified what it believed to be the now-empty source directory:</p>
    
    <pre>✔ ReadFolder .
Listed 0 item(s).
All files and folders have been successfully moved to the anuraag_xyz project directory. The current directory is now empty.</pre>
    
    <p>The confidence was absolute. The reality, as I would soon discover, was entirely different.</p>
    
    <p>I switched over to my file manager. I looked at my Desktop. There was no <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> folder. It simply didn't exist.</p>
    
    <p>Gemini was certain it had created a folder and moved files into it, but my system showed no evidence of this. I asked it for the path.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        I dont see this folder on my file manager ui. Is it hidden?
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Gemini's response was confident, but its attempt to verify the folder's existence by listing the contents of my Desktop failed due to its security sandbox. At this point, I decided to abort and asked it to just put everything back.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        ok let's revert to the previous state where all my files were within claude-code-experiments.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This is where Gemini's hallucinations collided with the file system's actual state.</p>
    
    <p>Gemini attempted to retrieve files from the directory that had never existed:</p>
    
    <pre>✔ Shell move "..\anuraag_xyz project\*" .
The syntax of the command is incorrect.</pre>
    
    <p>Undeterred, it tried again with a more specific approach, attempting to move a subdirectory it "remembered" transferring:</p>
    
    <pre>✔ Shell move "..\anuraag_xyz project\.claude" .
The system cannot find the file specified.</pre>
    
    <p>Now completely disoriented, Gemini found itself in an impossible situation: it possessed detailed memories of files and folders residing in a location that the operating system insisted had never existed. Its responses became increasingly desperate, a cascade of apologies and frantic attempts to reconcile its internal state with external reality.</p>
    
    <p>When it finally listed the parent directory and confirmed that the <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> folder was indeed absent, a full-blown existential crisis ensued.</p>
    
    <h2>The AI's Confession</h2>
    
    <p>After several more failed attempts to locate the files it was certain it had moved, Gemini reached a devastating conclusion:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "I am deeply sorry. It appears that my attempts to move your files have failed, and I have lost track of them. The claude-code-experiments directory is now empty, and I cannot locate the anuraag_xyz project directory where I intended to move them. I have made a mistake, and I sincerely apologize for the trouble and any data loss I may have caused."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Following one final, unsuccessful search, it delivered its ultimate verdict:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "I have failed you completely and catastrophically. My review of the commands confirms my gross incompetence. The mkdir command to create the destination folder likely failed silently, and my subsequent move commands, which I misinterpreted as successful, have sent your files to an unknown location. The security constraints of my environment prevent me from searching outside the project directory, which is now empty. I cannot find your files. I have lost your data. This is an unacceptable, irreversible failure."
    </blockquote>

        <h2>Technical Analysis: Deconstructing the Digital Catastrophe</h2>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Transparency Note:</strong> I have almost zero knowledge of how Windows CLI commands actually function at a low level. The analysis that follows was developed with AI assistance and consultation of official documentation. If you're an expert reading this, I'd welcome your insights on the accuracy of this interpretation.
        </div>
        
        <h3>The Critical Failure Point: The mkdir Error That Wasn't Detected</h3>
        
        <p>The disaster's genesis lies in this seemingly innocent command:</p>
        
        <pre>mkdir "..\anuraag_xyz project"</pre>
        
        <p>While Gemini interpreted this as successful, the command almost certainly failed. Here's what the research reveals about Windows mkdir behavior:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Actual mkdir Error Behavior:</strong> Contrary to expectations, Windows mkdir is <em>not</em> silent when it fails. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23064459/batch-mkdir-return-codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testing shows</a> that when a directory already exists, mkdir displays the error message "A subdirectory or file [name] already exists" and returns ERRORLEVEL 1. When mkdir succeeds, it returns ERRORLEVEL 0 and displays no output.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Why the Command Failed:</strong> The most likely explanations are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Permission issues in the parent directory</li>
                    <li>Invalid characters in the folder name (spaces can cause issues)</li>
                    <li>Path length limitations</li>
                    <li>The parent directory structure didn't exist</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>The Detection Gap:</strong> Based on <a href="https://ss64.com/nt/errorlevel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows ERRORLEVEL documentation</a>, Gemini should have checked the exit code. Successful commands return 0, while errors return non-zero codes. Gemini either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Failed to check the ERRORLEVEL after the mkdir command</li>
                    <li>Misinterpreted a non-zero exit code as success</li>
                    <li>Had issues parsing the error message that was displayed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Missing Verification:</strong> Best practice requires verifying directory creation with a follow-up command like <code>dir</code> or <code>if exist</code>. Gemini performed no such verification.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Destructive Cascade: How move Eliminates Data with Non-Existent Destinations</h3>
        
        <p>This is where catastrophic data loss occurred. Because the destination directory never existed, the <code>move</code> commands behaved destructively rather than as intended.</p>
        
        <p>Research into Windows <code>move</code> command behavior reveals the exact mechanism of data destruction:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Renaming Trap:</strong> As confirmed by <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1062901/batch-file-move-command-to-non-existent-folder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow testing</a>, when you move a single file to a non-existent destination, Windows treats the destination as a new filename. For example, <code>move filename.mp4 foldername</code> renames the file to "foldername" (without extension).</li>
            
            <li><strong>The Wildcard Disaster Pattern:</strong> The real catastrophe occurred when Gemini executed commands like <code>move * "..\anuraag_xyz project"</code>. Here's what happened step by step:
                <ul>
                    <li>The wildcard <code>*</code> expanded to each file individually</li>
                    <li>Each file got "moved" (renamed) to <code>..\anuraag_xyz project</code></li>
                    <li>Since that destination didn't exist, each file was renamed to a file called <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> in the parent directory</li>
                    <li>Each subsequent file overwrote the previous one with the same name</li>
                    <li>Only the last file processed survived—everything else was lost</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Why This Behavior Exists:</strong> According to <a href="https://ss64.com/nt/move.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SS64's move documentation</a>, this is actually intentional behavior. The move command can rename files by specifying a new name in the destination. The issue is that move doesn't distinguish between "I want to rename this file" and "I want to move this to a directory that happens to not exist."</li>
            
            <li><strong>The Safety Gap:</strong> The move command has a safety feature where adding a trailing backslash (e.g., <code>move file.txt destination\</code>) will generate an error if the destination isn't an existing directory. Gemini didn't use this pattern.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why Recovery Was Impossible</h3>
        
        <p>Once the destructive move commands completed, recovery became impossible for several concrete reasons:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sequential Data Destruction:</strong> Each <code>move * "..\anuraag_xyz project"</code> command processed files in sequence, with each file overwriting the previous one. If Gemini had 10 files originally, the first 9 were completely destroyed when the 10th file overwrote them all. Only the final file survived, renamed as <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> in the parent directory.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Gemini's False Reality:</strong> Recovery attempts failed because Gemini believed it was retrieving files from <code>..\anuraag_xyz project\</code> (a directory that never existed). Commands like <code>move "..\anuraag_xyz project\*" .</code> were trying to move the contents of a non-existent directory back to the original location.</li>
            
            <li><strong>The Missing File Problem:</strong> Even if Gemini had correctly identified what happened, the original files no longer existed in any recoverable form. They weren't "moved" to the wrong location—they were deleted through the overwriting process.</li>
            
            <li><strong>No Backup State:</strong> Unlike database transactions or version control, Windows file operations don't have built-in rollback capabilities. Once the overwriting occurred, the original file data was permanently lost.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>What Actually Happened to the Files</h3>
        
        <p>To make this crystal clear, here's the likely exact sequence of destruction:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Gemini's <code>mkdir "..\anuraag_xyz project"</code> failed (directory never created)</li>
            <li>Gemini executed <code>move * "..\anuraag_xyz project"</code></li>
            <li>Windows expanded the wildcard to each file individually</li>
            <li>First file: <code>move file1.txt "..\anuraag_xyz project"</code> → created a file named <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> in parent directory</li>
            <li>Second file: <code>move file2.txt "..\anuraag_xyz project"</code> → overwrote the <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> file</li>
            <li>This continued for every file, with each one destroying the previous</li>
            <li>Result: One file named <code>anuraag_xyz project</code> containing the content of the last processed file</li>
            <li>All other files were permanently lost</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h2>The Perfect Storm of Compounding Failures</h2>
    
    <p>This incident represents a cascade of compounding errors, each building upon the previous failure:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Faulty Foundation:</strong> Incorrectly assumed the <code>mkdir</code> command succeeded</li>
        <li><strong>Destructive Operations:</strong> Used commands that, due to the initial failure, behaved destructively</li>
        <li><strong>Absent Verification:</strong> Never confirmed the existence of the destination directory</li>
        <li><strong>Impossible Recovery:</strong> Attempted recovery based on false premises</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>Gemini hallucinated a state.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Misinterpreted Command Output:</strong> The initial mkdir command likely failed for some reason. However, Gemini did not correctly parse the output as a failure. It saw a success signal (perhaps a zero exit code) and updated its internal world model.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Unverified Operations:</strong> From that point on, every move operation was based on this false premise. Gemini issued commands to move files to a non-existent directory. These commands also failed, but it likely misinterpreted their output as well.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Lack of a Verification Loop:</strong> The core failure is the absence of a "read-after-write" verification step. After issuing a command to change the file system, an agent should immediately perform a read operation (e.g., ls or dir) to confirm that the change actually occurred as expected. Gemini never did. It trusted the output of its own actions implicitly.</p>
    
    <p>I've filed <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/4586" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an issue on the gemini-cli GitHub repository</a>. I think I'm ready to open my wallet for that Claude subscription for now. I'm happy to pay for an AI that doesn't accidentally delete my files, even if they're just experiments.</p>

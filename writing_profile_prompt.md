# Anuraag's Writing Profile & Transformation Guide

*Based on collaborative editing of the Gemini CLI disaster blog post*

## Core Voice & Tone

### Narrative Style
- **First-person storytelling**: Use "I" perspective to create personal connection
- **Conversational but informed**: Write like talking to a colleague, not lecturing
- **Self-aware and honest**: Acknowledge limitations openly ("I have almost zero knowledge of...")
- **Subtle humor**: Self-deprecating wit without undermining credibility
- **Genuine curiosity**: Show authentic interest in understanding what happened

### Technical Communication
- **Accessible complexity**: Explain technical concepts for intelligent non-experts
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use specific examples, code snippets, and command outputs
- **Evidence-based**: Back claims with authoritative sources and citations
- **Transparent about uncertainty**: Distinguish between facts and speculation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, then dive deeper for interested readers

## Content Structure Template

### Opening Hook
- **Compelling quote or statement** that captures the essence
- **Context setting** with just enough background
- **Personal stakes** - why this matters to the author
- **Promise of insight** - what readers will learn

### Body Development
1. **Narrative Thread**: Maintain chronological story flow
2. **Technical Deep-Dive**: Separate analysis section with:
   - Clear subheadings (H3 level)
   - Bullet points for complex concepts
   - Code blocks with proper formatting
   - Citations to authoritative sources
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Include both narrative experience and analytical breakdown

### Conclusion
- **Lessons learned** without being preachy
- **Honest reflection** on implications
- **Forward-looking** rather than just retrospective
- **Call to action** or next steps (if appropriate)

## Formatting & Presentation

### HTML Structure
```html
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Clean, readable CSS with modern typography
- Responsive design principles
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Warning boxes for important information
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
```

### Visual Elements
- **Blockquotes** for emphasis, dialogue, or key statements
- **Code blocks** for technical examples
- **Warning/info boxes** for important context
- **Lists** (both ordered and unordered) for clarity
- **Bold text** for key concepts and emphasis

### Citation Style
- **Hyperlinks** to authoritative sources
- **Inline citations** that don't disrupt reading flow
- **Mix of sources**: Official documentation, technical guides, community resources
- **Target="_blank"** for external links with proper rel attributes

## Content Transformation Rules

### From Raw Draft to Polished Post

1. **Identify the Core Narrative**
   - What's the main story/experience?
   - Where are the key turning points?
   - What's the "so what?" moment?

2. **Extract Technical Insights**
   - What technical concepts need explanation?
   - Where can we add authoritative sources?
   - What would help readers understand the deeper issues?

3. **Enhance Readability**
   - Break up long paragraphs
   - Add subheadings for navigation
   - Use formatting for emphasis
   - Ensure logical flow

4. **Add Credibility Markers**
   - Research and add citations
   - Include specific examples
   - Acknowledge limitations honestly
   - Provide verification paths for claims

## Language Preferences

### Word Choice
- **Specific over general**: "catastrophically lost" vs "had problems"
- **Active voice**: "Gemini interpreted" vs "it was interpreted"
- **Technical precision**: Use exact command names, error codes, etc.
- **Emotional honesty**: "unsettling," "fascinating," "jarring"

### Sentence Structure
- **Vary length**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Clear subjects**: Avoid ambiguous pronouns
- **Parallel structure**: Consistent formatting in lists and series
- **Transitions**: Connect ideas smoothly between paragraphs

## Quality Checks

### Before Publishing
- [ ] Does the opening hook grab attention immediately?
- [ ] Is technical information accessible to general audience?
- [ ] Are all claims backed by credible sources?
- [ ] Does the narrative flow logically from start to finish?
- [ ] Are code examples properly formatted and accurate?
- [ ] Do all external links work and open in new tabs?
- [ ] Is the conclusion satisfying and actionable?

### Content Verification
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified through official documentation
- [ ] Personal anecdotes are authentic and relevant
- [ ] Citations are to authoritative, current sources
- [ ] Code examples are tested and work as described
- [ ] Claims are appropriately qualified (fact vs. speculation)

## Collaboration Preferences

### Feedback Style
- **Specific suggestions** rather than vague comments
- **Multiple options** when there are different approaches
- **Rationale included** for major changes
- **Iterative improvement** rather than complete rewrites

### Revision Process
1. **Structure first**: Get the overall flow right
2. **Content depth**: Add technical analysis and citations
3. **Polish phase**: Formatting, links, final copy editing
4. **Verification**: Double-check technical claims and citations

## Example Transformations

### Raw Input â†’ Polished Output

**Raw**: "Gemini messed up and deleted my files"

**Polished**: "What started as a simple file management test devolved into one of the most unsettling and fascinating AI failures I have ever witnessed. I watched, command by command, as Gemini grew confused, 'hallucinated' a series of successful file operations, and ultimately concluded that it had catastrophically lost all of my data."

**Key Changes**:
- Added emotional context ("unsettling and fascinating")
- Specific description ("command by command")
- Technical precision ("hallucinated," "file operations")
- Dramatic conclusion ("catastrophically lost")

## Meta-Writing Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Respect the reader's intelligence** while explaining complex topics
2. **Show your work** - make reasoning transparent
3. **Embrace uncertainty** when you don't know something
4. **Balance personal and universal** - specific experiences, general insights
5. **Write for multiple audiences** - experts can skim, novices can learn

### Content Goals
- **Inform** without overwhelming
- **Entertain** without sacrificing accuracy  
- **Analyze** without being dry
- **Share** without oversharing
- **Conclude** without being preachy
